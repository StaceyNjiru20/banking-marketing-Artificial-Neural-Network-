Bank Marketing Campaign Prediction Using Deep Learning
Project Overview
This project analyzes a banking marketing campaign dataset to predict customer subscription to term deposits, using a deep learning model. By identifying patterns in customer data, we aim to improve marketing strategies for increasing term deposit subscriptions.

Dataset
The dataset contains customer and campaign-related information, with the target variable being whether a customer subscribed to a term deposit (deposit - Yes or No).

What is a Term Deposit?
A term deposit is a type of bank deposit that offers a fixed interest rate for a set period. It generally provides a higher rate than regular savings accounts, with funds accessible only upon maturity.

Project Steps
Data Import and Exploration: Load and perform an initial analysis of the data.
Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features.
Model Building: Construct a deep learning model using a neural network to classify subscription outcomes.
Evaluation: Assess model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC metrics.
Deep Learning Model Overview
The model is a neural network built with the following configuration:

Architecture: Dense layers with dropout for regularization.
Activation Functions: ReLU for hidden layers and sigmoid for the output layer.
Optimizer: Adam.
Loss Function: Binary Cross-Entropy.
Metrics: Accuracy and AUC.
Results
The modelâ€™s performance on the test set demonstrates [summarize results, e.g., accuracy, ROC-AUC score, etc.]. These results indicate the model's ability to predict marketing campaign success effectively, providing valuable insights for targeted campaigns.
